# Rapidly-exploring-Random-Tree-RRT-
This repository contains a 2D ship path-planning simulation implemented in Java using the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm. The project focuses on autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance, with visual simulation of generated paths.

The repo also includes a LaTeX document explaining RRT, RRT*, and core path-planning concepts.
